# Analyzing Promotion Effectiveness with ANOVA

# Business Problem
As a data professional supporting our marketing team, I was tasked with uncovering whether different promotion types—like TV ads, social media campaigns, radio spots, and influencer partnerships—actually led to meaningful differences in sales. I explored the historical data, using visuals and descriptive stats to pinpoint a key promotional factor. From there, I built and validated a regression model, then ran a one-way ANOVA and post hoc test to dig deeper into group differences. The insights I shared helped the team confidently fine-tune their strategy and invest in the channels that truly drive results.

# Project Goals
To identify whether different types of marketing promotions (TV, social media, radio, influencer) lead to statistically significant differences in sales, and to provide the team actionable insights that guide marketing strategy and budget allocation.

# Skills and Tools Applied
- Exploratory Data Analysis (Python: pandas, seaborn, matplotlib)
- Regression Modeling (Python: statsmodels, scikit-learn)
- Diagnostic Checking (Python: sm.qqplot(), scipy.stats, seaborn)
- Hypothesis Testing and Statistical Inference (Python: statsmodels, scipy.stats)
- Post Hoc Analysis (e.g., Tukey’s HSD) (Python: statsmodels.stats.multicomp.pairwise_tukeyhsd())
- Insight Communication / Data Storytelling (Jupyter Notebook with Markdown cells)
